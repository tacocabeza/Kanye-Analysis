The day his father passed away\nLeft him with a lil' somethin', sixteen, he was stuntin'\nAl B. Sure! nigga with the hair all wavy\nHit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy\nHit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty\nBoned so much that summer, even had him a baby\nSee back-back then-then, if you had a car\nYou was the Chi-Town version of Baby\nAnd I was just a virgin, a baby\nOne of the reasons I looked up to him crazy\nI used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked\nFelt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked\nWe'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall\nThey had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin' 'em all\nWith the girls a lot of flirtin' involved, but dog\nFuck all that flirtin' now I'm tryin' to get in some drawers\nSo put me on with these hoes, homie\nHe told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nDrive slow, homie\nDrive slow\nYou never know, homie, about these hoes, homie\nYou need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie\n\n[Verse 2: Paul Wall]\nWhat it do? I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk waving\nThe candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazing\nThem elbows pokin' wide on that candy 'Lac\nTrunk open, screens on, neons lit with fifth relaxed\nI'm on a mission for dime-pieces and sexy ladies\nAllow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes\nIt's a star-studded event when I valet park\nOpen up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark\nYou see them fours crawling? You see them screens falling?\nThe disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'\nI'm leaning on the switch, sitting crooked in my slab\nBut I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab\nA young Houston hardhitter all about the scrilla\nRidin' something candy-coated, crawling like a caterpillar\nI'm tipping on them fours, I'm jamming on that Screw\nI'm looking for them hoes, baby, what it do? Drive slow, homie\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West & GLC]\nTurn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes\nDrive slow, homie\nIf you're riding around the city with nowhere to go\nDrive slow, homie\nLive today, cause tomorrow, man, you never know\nYou never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie\nYou need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie\n\n[Verse 3: GLC & Kanye West]\nMy car's like the movie, my car's like the crib\nI got more TVs in here than where I live\nAnd that don't make no sense, but baby, I'm the shit\nAnd everything I flip, you know it's something serious\nI got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims\nI got the baller genetics, baby this evidence\nYou see a player flicking, and how you ain't convinced\nThat you should go on and kiss it, just a lil bit (just a lil bit)\nI got my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain\nMy canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings\nThey see me, hoes actin like they seen a king\nWith that mean lean, smoking on that finest Cali green\nMy woodgrain oak, I'm ridin on Vogues\nMy cylinder quiet, like tip-toes\nI sold O's, and this I know\nWhen you see them hoes, lil' homie, drive slow\n(drive slow, drive slow)\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah\nDrive slow, homie\nDrive slow, homie\nYou never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie\nYou need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie\nDrive slow, homie"

Kel', I bail and it -\n\n[Outro: Gil Scott-Heron]\n\"Might not be such a bad idea if I never\nNever went home again\nI'm on my way home\nI left three days ago, but no one seems to know I'm gone\nHome is where the hatred is; home is filled with pain and it\nMight not be such a bad idea if I never\nNever went home again\""

Remember when I was 9?\nTell her everything gon' be fine, but I be lyin'\nHer family cryin', they want her to live, and she tryin'\nI'm arguin' like what kind of doctor can we fly in\nYou know the best medicine go to people that's paid\nIf Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS\nAnd all the broke motherfuckers passed away\nYou telling me if my grandma's in the NBA\nRight now she'd be okay? But since she\nWas just a secretary, worked for the church for 35 years\nThings 'sposed to stop right here\nMy grandfather tryin' to pull it together, he's strong\nThat's where I get my confidence from\nI asked the nurse \"Did you do the research?\"\nShe asked me, \"Can you sign some t-shirts?\"\nBitch, is you smokin reefer?\nYou don't see that we hurt?

Forever ever? Ever ever?\nEver ever? Ever ever? Ever ever? Ever ever?)\n\n[Verse 1: Kanye West]\nGood mornin', this ain't Vietnam still\nPeople lose hands, legs, arms, for real\nLittle was known of Sierra Leone\nAnd how it connect to the diamonds we own\nWhen I speak of diamonds in this song\nI ain't talkin' about the ones that be glowin'\nI'm talkin' about Roc-a-Fella, my home\nMy chain, these ain't conflict diamonds\nIs they, Jacob? Don't lie to me, man\nSee, a part of me sayin' keep shinin'\nHow when I know what a blood diamond is?\nThough it's thousands of miles away\nSierra Leone connects to what we go through today\nOver here it's a drug trade, we die from drugs\nOver there they die from what we buy from drugs\nThe diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses\nI thought my Jesus piece was so harmless\n'Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless\nAnd here's the conflict\nIt's in a black person soul to rock that gold\nSpend your whole life tryin' to get that ice\nOn a Polo rugby, it looks so nice\nHow can somethin' so wrong make me feel so right?\nRight? 'Fore I beat myself up like Ike\nYou can still throw your Roc-a-Fella diamond tonight, 'cause\n\n[Hook: Kanye West & Shirley Bassey sample]\n(Diamonds are forever forever forever)\nThrow your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe\n(Diamonds are forever, forever, forever)\nThe Roc is still alive every time I rhyme\nForever ever?

Are y'all okay, man?\"\n\n[Verse 3: JAY-Z]\nYup, I got it from here, 'Ye, damn\nThe chain remains, the gang is intact (Uh-huh)\nThe name is mine, I'll take blame for that\nThe pressure's on, but guess who ain't gonna crack?\nHaha, pardon me, I had to laugh at that\nHow could you falter when you're the Rock of Gibraltar?\nI had to get off the boat so I could walk on water\nThis ain't no tall order, this is nothin' to me\nDifficult takes a day, impossible takes a week\nI do this in my sleep\nI sold kilos of coke, I'm guessin' I can sell CD's\nI'm not a businessman; I'm a business, man!\nLet me handle my business, damn\nKanyeez you got me, Freeway then Foxy\nYG's, Teairra Mari, Peedi watch me\nBleek could be one hit away his whole career\nAs long as I'm alive he's a millionaire\nAnd even if I die he's in my will somewhere\nSo he could just kick back and chill somewhere\nOh yeah, he don't even have to write rhymes\nThe Dynasty like my money: last three lifetimes\nShirley Bassey's in the rear\nSayin' exactly what I've been sayin' practically my whole career\nThe diamond is forever, I've been minin' this forever\nNow the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better\nPeople lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'\nInstead we rose up from the ash like a phoenix\nIf you're waitin' for the end of the Dynasty sign\nIt would seem like forever is a mighty long time\n(I'm Young, bitches!)

Should I freestyle or write?\nHe said, \"Nas, what the fans want is Illmatic, still\"\nLooked at the pad and pencil, and jotted what I feel\nBeen like twelve years since a nigga first signed\nNow, I'm a free agent, and I'm thinking it's time\nTo build my very own Motown\n'Cause rappers be deprived of executive nine-to-fives\nAnd it hurts to see these companies be stealing the life\nAnd I love to give my blood, sweat and tears to the mic\nSo y'all copped the LPs and y'all fiends got dealt\nI'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony when King got killed\nI survived the livest niggas around\nLasted longer than more than half of you clowns\nLook, I used to cook before I had the game took\nEither way, my change came like Sam Cooke\n\n[Bridge: Tony Williams & Nas]\nBa-dop-ba-ba (Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)\nFeeling better than I ever felt before today\nLike better late than never; it's orientation\nStill, we can make it better, throwing all your cares away\nOh, oh, oh, ooh!\n\n[Chorus: Really Doe & Tony Williams]\nYou motherfuckers better do your job and roll up\nAnd watch how we roll up, and (Ba-dop-ba-ba)\nI can't control it, I can't hold it, it's so nuts\nI take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck\nI take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck\nBut really what's amazing is how I keep blazing\nTowel under the door, we smoke until the day's end\nPuff-puff, then pass, don't fuck up rotation\nHpnotiq for Henny? Now, nigga, that's a chaser (Oh, oh, oh, ooh!)\nTurn nothing to something, now, pimping, that's a savior (Ba-dop-ba-ba)\nBest things are green, now, pimpin', get your paper\nHigh off the ground, from stair to skyscraper\nCool out, thinking we local, c'mon, homie, we major\n\n[Hook: Kanye West & Nas]\nWe major? (C'mon, homie, we major)\nWe major? (C'mon, homie, we major)\nWe major (C'mon, homie, we major)\nWe major\n\n[Bridge: Tony Williams]\nOh, oh, oh, ooh! Ba-dop-ba-ba\nFeeling better than I ever felt before today\nBut better late than never; it's orientation\nStill, we can make it better, throwing all your cares away\nOh, oh, oh, ooh!\n\n[Spoken: Kanye West & Tony Williams]\nCan I talk my shit again?\nCan I talk my shit again?\nI can't believe I'm back up in this motherfucker\nI'ma be late, though\nI gotta figure out what I'm finna wear\nYeah\nThe Roc is definitely in the building\nG.O.O.D. Music's definitely in the building, ugh\nI gotta say \"What's up\" to Tony Williams\nOn the vocals!\nSings\u2014He sings quite beautifully, don't you agree?\nDon't you agree?\nUgh\nAnd Jon Brion on the keys right now\nAnd Warryn Campbell on the keys right now\nSo they asked me:\n\"Why you call it Late Registration, 'Ye?\"\n'Cause we takin these motherfuckers back to school\nLa, la, la, la-la-la-la la\nIf you know this part right here, feel free to sing along\nLa la la la la, la-la-la\n\n[Outro: Tony Williams & Kanye West]\nBa-dop-bop-ba (Oh)\nFeeling better than I ever felt before today (If you feeling good)\nBut better late than never; it's orientation (It's orientation)\nBut we can make it better, throwing all your cares away\nWe want you to get used to this\nOh, oh, oh, ooh! Ba-dop-bop-ba\nUgh, they can't do what we do, baby\nUh-uh! They can't do what we do baby\nUh-uh! They can't do what we do, baby\nYeah\nOh, oh, oh, ooh!"

Groupies say I'm too choosy\nTake 'em to the show and talk all through the movies\nSay she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays\nIf we up in Fridays, I still have it my way, gone!\n\n[Hook 1: Cam'ron]\nGone (We striving home)\nGone (I ride on chrome)\nIt's too late\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nY'all don't want no prob' from me\nWhat you rappers could get is a job from me\nMaybe you could be my intern, and in turn\nI'll show you how I cook up summer in the winter\nAaron love the raw dog, when will he learn\nCaught something on the Usher tour, he had to let it burn\nPlus, he already got three chil'r'n\nArguin' over babysitters like, \"Bitch, it's your turn\"\n\"Damn, Ye, it'd be stupid to diss you\nEven your superficial raps is super-official\"\nR-R-R-Roc Pastelle with Gucci on\nWith TVs in the ride, throw a movie on\nSaid he couldn't rap, now he at the top with Doobie Long\n'Cause I dookied on any song that they threw me on, gone\n\n[Hook 2: Cam'ron]\nWe striving home, gone\nI ride on chrome\nWe striving home\nWe striving home, gone (Killa)\nI ride on chrome\n\n[Verse 3: Cam'ron]\nKnock knock, who's there?

Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?\nEver, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?\n\n[Verse 1: Kanye West]\nClose your eyes and imagine, feel the magic\nVegas on acid, seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses\nAnd I've realized that I've arrived\n'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe\n\"Does he write his own rhymes?\" Well, sort of, I think 'em\nThat mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of\n\"Damn, is he really that caught up?\"\nI ask, if you talkin' about classics, do my name get brought up?\nI remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort\nOr even a four-track recorder\nSo it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche\nSpoil yourself, that's important\nIf your stripper name \"Porsche\" and you get tips from many men\nThen your fat friend, her nickname is \"Minivan\"\nExcuse me, that's just the Henny, man\nI smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't, because\u2014\n\n[Hook: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]\nDiamonds are forever (forever, forever)\nThrow your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe\nDiamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)\nThe Roc is still alive every time I rhyme\nForever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?\nEver, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nI was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me\nOnly playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry\nAlicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him\nThirty minutes later seein' there's no convincin' him\nWhat more could you ask for? The international asshole\nWho complain about what he is owed?\nAnd throw a tantrum like he is three years old\nYou gotta love it though: somebody still speaks from his soul\nAnd wouldn't change by the change or the game or the fame\nWhen he came in the game, he made his own lane\nNow all I need is y'all to pronounce my name\nIt's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say \"Kayne\"\nGot family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown\nBack in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town\nLife movin' too fast, I need to slow down\nGirl ain't give me no ass, you need to go down\nMy father been said I need Jesus\nSo he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar\nThe preacher said we need leaders\nRight then, my body got still like a paraplegic\nYou know who you call; you got a message, then leave it\nThe Roc stand tall and you would never believe it\nTake your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic\nYeah, the beat cold, but the flow is anemic\nAfter debris settles and the dust get swept off\nBig K pick up where young Hov left off\nRight when magazines wrote Kanye West off\nI dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of\nA&R's lookin' like, \"Pssh, we messed up.\"\nGrammy night, damn right, we got dressed up\nBottle after bottle 'til we got messed up\nIn the studio with Really Doe, yeah, he next up\nPeople askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back\nThat'll be the same day I give the game back\nYou know the next question, dog: \"Yo, where Dame at?\"\nThis track the Indian dance to bring our reign back\n\"What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?\"\nThey pray for the death of our dynasty like \"Amen\"\nR-r-r-r-right here stands a man\nWith the power to make a diamond with his bare hands\n\n[Hook: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]\nDiamonds are forever (forever, forever)\nThrow your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe\nDiamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)\nThe Roc is still alive every time I rhyme\nForever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?\nEver, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?\n\n[Outro: Shirley Bassey]\nDiamonds are forever (forever, forever)\nDiamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)"
