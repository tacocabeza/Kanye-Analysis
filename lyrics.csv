see how it feels\nPeople say ""don\'t say this, don\'t say that""\nJust say it out loud, just to see how it feels\nWeigh all the options, nothing\'s off the table\nToday, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder\nI think about killing myself\nAnd I, I love myself way more than I love you\nThe most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest\n(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)\nI

""He died so young""\nI done had a bad case of too many bad days\nGot too many bad traits, used the floor for ashtrays\nI don\'t do shit halfway, I\'ma clear the cache\nI\'ma make my name last, put that on my last name\nIt\'s a different type of rules that we obey\nYe, Ye, Ye season, nigga, we Old Bay\nWe was all born to die, nigga, DOA\nNiggas say they hero, mm, I don\'t see no cape\nMm, I

Russell]\nBaby lion goes\nWhere the islands go\n\n[Verse 1: Kanye West]\nYou say you never saw this comin', well, you're not alone\nMillion dollar renovations to a happy home\nMy ex says she gave me the best years of her life\nI saw a recent picture of her, I guess she was right\nI wake up, assessin' the damages\nCheckin' MediaTakeOut\nPictures of me drunk walkin' out with a bitch\nBut it's blurry enough to get the fake out\nI wake up, all veggies no eggs\nI hit the gym, all chest no legs\nYep, then I made myself a smoothie\nYeah, then me and wifey make a movie\nChicago - St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago\nÁndale, ándale E.I, E.I, uh-oh\nYou had me drivin' far enough to switch the time zone\nYou was the best of all time at the time though\nYeah, you wasn't mine though\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nBut I still drove 30 hours\nAnd I, I still drove 30 hours to you, yeah\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nI remember rappin' for Jay and Cam\nYoung producer just trying to get his flows off\nI remember being nervous to do Victoria's Secret\n'Til I pictured everybody with they clothes off\nExpedition was Eddie Bauer edition\nI'm drivin' with no winter tires in December\nSkrrt, skrrt, skrrt, like a private school for women\nThen I get there and all the Popeye's is finished, girl\nYou don't love me, you just pretendin'\nI need a happy beginnin', middle and endin'\nChicago, St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago\nIt's gettin' hot in here, that's all that I know\nGot a hotel room, three stars for you\nYou call down for an omelet, girl, it's 5 in the morning\nYou realize we at the DoubleTree, not the Aria\nOnly thing open is Waffle House, girl, don't start with me\nI used the Western Union for you like it's no prob'\n'Cause you was in college complainin' 'bout it's no jobs\nBut you were suckin' a nigga dick the whole time\nWell, I guess a blowjob's better than no job\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nAnd I drove back 30 hours\n\n[Bridge: Arthur Russell]\nWhere the main ties onto the sail\nBetter on sighting\nFor astern, oh\n\n[Outro: Kanye West & André 3000]\n3 Stacks, can you help me out?\n30 hours\nYeah, this type of shit you just ride out to\n30 hours\n30 hours\nI just be like, it was my idea to have an open relationship\nNow a nigga mad\nNow I'm 'bout to drive 90 miles like Matt Barnes to kill...\n30 hours\nJust to kill..\nJust to...\nJust to...\nI'm about to drive 90\n90 miles like Matt Barnes just to whoop a nigga ass\nIt was my idea and now a nigga (30 hours)\nNow a nigga mad, now a nigga, uh\nA stunna\nWhoop him after school just to show I got class\nDuh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh\nDuh-duh with you, yeah (30 hours)\nYou know what I'm sayin'? Drop some shit like that\nAyy, ayy whoop him after school just to\n30 hours\nWhoop him after school just to show I got class\nUh, 3 Stacks\n30 hours\nJust ride out to that\nCheck it out: this the bonus track, this the bonus\n30 hours\nMy favorite albums used to have like bonus joints like this\nThat's why they kick it off like this\nYeah, just did that Madison Square Garden\n30 hours\nHad to put the flyest nigga on this shit, ayy, ayy\nThe pyramids shall rise\n30 hours\nLook at these ultralight beams flowin'\nFor all the moms, the dads, the kids, the families that shared this moment with us\nLet's rock out for 'bout\n30 hours\nYou know, ayy, you know\nAyy, you know, ayy, you know\n30 hours\nWhole design team, Yeezy team, music team\nRemember when the whole block'd get shout out?\nThis my version of a shout-out track\n30 hours\nLet that mothafucka rock, let that, let that, yeah\nTo my brother Yasiin, holding it down in Africa\n30 hours\nTo my family: thank you for holding me down\nThe media be acting like\n30 hours\nThat's Gabe calling\nYo Gabe\nI'm just doing a...

ain\'t that serious\nMhm, that\'s that shit\nSo if you gon\' do it, do it just like this\n\n[Refrain]\nDid you realize\nThat you were a champion in their eyes?\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou don\'t see just how wild the crowd is\nYou don\'t see just how fly my style is\nI don\'t see why I need a stylist\nWhen I shop so much I can speak Italian\nI don\'t know, I just want it better for my kids\nAnd I ain\'t sayin\' we was from the projects\nBut every time I wanted layaway or a deposit\nMy dad\'d say ""when you see clothes, close your eyelids""\nWe was sort of like Will Smith and his son\nIn the movie, I ain\'t talkin\' \'bout the rich ones\n\'Cause every summer he\'d get some\nBrand new harebrained scheme to get rich from\nAnd I don\'t know what he did for dough\nBut he\'d send me back to school with a new wardrobe, but ayy\n\n[Refrain]\nDid you realize\nThat you were a champion in their eyes?\n\n[Chorus 2]\nI think he did\nWhen he packed it up and brought it back to the crib\nJust a little

champion in their eyes?\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen it feel like living\'s harder than dyin\'\nFor me givin\' up\'s way harder than tryin\'\nLauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion\nI wish her heart still was in rhymin\'\n\'Cause who the kids gon\' listen to, huh?\nI guess me if it isn\'t you\nLast week I paid a visit to the institute\nThey got the dropout keepin\' kids in the school\nI guess I cleaned up my act like Prince\'d do\nIf not for pleasure, then at least for the principle\nThey got the CD, they got to see me\nDrop gems like I dropped out of PE\nThey used to feel invisible\nNow they know they invincible\n\n[Refrain]\nDid you realize\nThat you were a champion in their eyes?\n\n[Bridge]\nThis is the story of a champion\nRunners on their mark and they pop their guns\nStand up, stand up, here he comes\nTell me what it takes to be number one\nTell me what it takes to be number one\nThis is the story of a champion\nRunners on their mark and they pop their guns\nStand up, stand up, here he comes\nTell me what it takes to be number one\nTell me what it takes to be number one\n\n[Refrain]\nDid you realize\nThat you were a champion in their eyes?\n\n[Chorus 1]\nYes I did\nSo I packed it up

Oh!\nNow I\'m comin\' home again\nMaybe we can start again\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nBut if you really cared for her\nThen you wouldn\'t\'ve never hit the airport to follow your dreams\nSometimes I still talk to her\nBut when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin\' \'bout me\nShe said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you\nThey wanna rap and make soul beats just like you\nBut they just not you,"" and I just got through\nTalkin\' \'bout what niggas tryin\' to do: just not new\nNow everybody got the game figured out all wrong\nI guess you never know what you got \'til it\'s gone\nI guess that\'s why I\'m here and I can\'t come back home\nAnd guess when I heard that? When I was back home\nEvery interview, I\'m representin\' you, makin\' you proud\nReach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloud\nJump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave \'em around\nIf you don\'t know by now, I\'m talkin\' \'bout Chi-Town\n\n[Chorus: Chris Martin]\nI\'m comin\' home again\nDo you think about me now and then?\nDo you think about me now and then?\n\'Cause I\'m comin\' home again\n-Min\' home again\nBaby, do you remember when\nFireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!\nNow I\'m comin\' home again\n-Min\' home again\nBaby, do you remember when\nFireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!\nNow I\'m comin\' home again\nMaybe we can start again\n\n[Outro: Chris Martin]\nLoy-oy-al, loy-oy-al\nComin\' home again\nLoy-oy-al, loy-oy-al\nComin\' home again\nMaybe we can start again'}",Graduation

Ivy]\nWe are all here for a reason on a particular path\nYou don\'t need a curriculum to know that you\'re a part of the math\nCats think I\'m delirious but I\'m so damn serious\nThat\'s why I expose my soul to the globe; the world\nI\'m trying to make it better for these little boys and girls\nI\'m not just another individual\nMy spirit is a part of this that\'s why I get spiritual\nBut I get my hymns from Him\nSo it\'s not me, it\'s He that\'s lyrical\nI\'m not a miracle, I\'m a heaven-sent instrument\nMy rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes\nFor your soul and your mental\nThat\'s why I\'m instrumental, vibrations is what I\'m into\nYeah I need my loot by rent day\nBut that ain\'t what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte\nI\'m trying to get us ""us free"" like Cinque\nI can\'t stop, that\'s why I\'m hot\nDetermination, dedication, motivation\nI\'m talking to you of my many inspirations\nWhen I say I can\'t let you or self-down\nIf I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff\nAnd if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life\nIn my grip, I would never ever let you down\nAnd when these words are found\nLet it be known that God\'s penmanship has been signed\nWith a language called love\nThat\'s why my breath is felt by the deaf\nAnd while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind\nI too dream in color and in rhyme\nSo I guess I\'m one of a kind in a full house\n\'Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth\nA touch of God reigns out\nTake \'em to church\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen it comes to being true, at least true to me\nOne thing I found, one thing I found\nOh no, you\'ll never let me down\nGet up, I get, get up, I get\nGet up, I get, get up, I get\nGet up, I get, get up, I get down\n\n[Verse 4: Jay-Z & Kanye West]\nWho else you know been hot this long?\n(Oh yeah, we ain\'t finished)\nStarted from nothing but he got this strong\n(The Roc is in the building)\nBuilt the Roc from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you\nPedaled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special (Wooooo)\nLet you tell it, man, I\'m falling\nWell, somebody must have caught him\n\'Cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan them\nNumber one albums, what I got? Like four of them\nMore of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way\nClear the way, I\'m here to stay\nY\'all can save the chitter chat, this and that\nThis is Jay, dissing Jay will get you maced\nWhen I start spitting them lyrics niggas get very religious\nSix Hail Marys, \'Please Father forgive us\'\nYoung the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y\'all niggas\nThe way y\'all all follow Jigga\nHov\'s a living legend and I\'ll tell you why\nEverybody wanna be Hov and Hov\'s still alive'}",The College Dropout

 i'm like oh shit i was messin' with uh ddot also people were like this started talking about the ghost production but that's how i got in the game if it wasn't for that i wouldn't be here so you know after they picked that truth beat i was figuring i was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that i was stayin' in chicago i had my own apartment i be doin' like just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on and then to go out and buy get a pelle pelle off layaway get some jordans or something or get a technomarine that's what we wore back then i made this one beat where i sped up this harold melvin sample i played it for hip over the phone he's like oh yo that shit is crazy jay might want it for this compilation album he doin' called the dynasty and at that time like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me so i went and um i was listening to dre chronic 00 at that time and really i just like bit the drums off xxplosive and put it like with a spedup sample and now it's kind of like my whole style when it started when he rapped on this can't be life  and that was like really the first beat of that kind that was on the dynasty album i could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound you know i got to come in and track the beat and at the time i was still with my other management i really wanted to roll with hip hop cause i i just needed some fresh air you know what i'm sayin' cause i been there for a while i appreciated what they did for me but you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change try to move up to the next level and that day i came and i tracked the beat and i got to meet jayz and he said oh you a real soulful dude  jayz oh you a real soulful dude man  and he uh played the song cause he already spit his by the time i got to the studio you know how he do it one take and he said  jayz check this out tell me what you think of this right here  tell me what you think of this and i heard it and i was thinking like man i really wanted more like of the simple type jayz i ain't want like the the more spective complicated rhy or the in my personal opinion so he asked me what you think of it  jayz so what you think of this  and i was like man that shit tight you know what i'm sayin' man what i'ma tell him i was on the train man you know so after that i went back home and man i'm i'm just in chicago i'm trying to do my thing you know i got groups i got acts i'm trying to get on and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been one of my homies that was one of my artists he got signed but it was supposed to really go through my production company but he ended up going straight with the company so like i'm just straight holdin' the phone gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company and i got evicted at the same time so i went down and tracked the beats from him i took that money came back packed all my shit up in a uhaul maybe about ten days before i had to actually get out so i ain't have to deal with the landlord cause he's a jerk me and my mother drove to  donda west come on let's just go  newark new jersey i hadn't even seen my apartment i remember i pulled up  donda west kanye baby we're here  i unpacked all my shit you know we went to ikea i bought a bed i put the bed together myself i loaded up all my equipment and the first beat i made was uh heart of the city and beans was still working on his album at that time so i came up there to baseline it was beans' birthday matter of fact and i played like seven beats and you know i guess he was in the zone he already had the beats that he wanted i had did nothing like it already at that time but then jay walked in i remember he had a gucci bucket hat on i remember it like like it was yesterday and hiphop said yo play that one beat for him and i played heart of the city and really i made heart of the city i really wanted to give that beat to dmx  hiphop no i think jay gon' like this one right here  and i played another beat and i played another beat and i remember that gucci bucket he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'ooooooooooh' two days later i'm in baseline and i seen dame dame didn't know who i was and i was like yo what's up i'm kanye  dame yo you that kid kanye  you that kid that gave all them beats to jay yo this nigga got classics to your beats  dame jay got classics g  you know i ain't talkin' shit i'm like oh shit and all this time i'm starstruck man i'm still thinking 'bout you know i'm picturing these niggas on the show the streets is watching i'm lookin' these were superstars in my eyes and they still are you know so jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day and in two days i gotta bring up one thing you know come back to the story the day i did the 'can't be life' beat on track i remember lenny s he had some louis vuitton sneakers on he think he fly and hip hop was there i think tyty john meneilly a bunch of people i didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room and i said yo jay i could rap and i spit this rap that said uh i'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit mayonnaise colored benz i push miracle whips and i saw his eyes light up when i said that line but you know the rest the rap was like real wack and shit so that's all the response he said man that was tight  jayz that that was cool that was hot  that was it you know i ain't get no deal then hehe okay fast forward so blueprint h to the izzo my first hit single and i just took that proudly built relationships with people my relationship with kweli i think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper because you know of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him man i appre i love him for that and at this time you know i didn't have a deal i had songs and i had relationships with all these ar's and they wanted beats from me so they'd call me up i'd play them some beats gimme a beat that sound like jayz you know they dick riders whatever so i'll play them these postblueprint beats or whatever and then i'll play my shit i'll be like yo but i rap too hey i guess they was lookin' at me crazy cause you know cause i ain't have a jersey on or whatever everybody out there listen here i played them 'jesus walks' and they didn't sign me you know what happened it was some ar's that fucked with me though but then like the heads it'd be somebody at the company that'll say naw like dave lighty fucked with me my nigga mel brought me to a bunch of labels jessica rivera man  jessica man you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign kanye for real  i'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up  y'all niggas is stupid  let's just say i didn't get my deal the nigga that was behind me i mean he wasn't even a nigga you know the person who actually kicked everything off was joe h from capitol records he wanted to sign me really bad  joe we gonna change the game buddy  dame was like yo you got a deal with capitol okay man just make sure it's not wack  dame you gotta make sure it's not wack  then one day i just went ahead and played it i wanted to play some songs cause you know cam was in the room young guru and dame was in the room so i played actually it's a song that you'll never hear but maybe i might use it so it's called 'wow'  i go to jacob with 5 thou you go with 5 hundred wow i got  plaques on my walls right now you got your first gold single damn nigga wow  like the  went don't bite that  i might still use it so i play that song for him and he's like oh shit  dame oh shit it's not even wack  i ain't gonna front it's kinda hot  dame it's actually kinda hot  like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper and i'm sure dame figured 'like man if he do a whole album if his raps is wack at least we can throw cam on every song and save the album you know so uh dame took me into the office and he's like yo man b b you don't want a brick you don't want a brick  dame you don't wanna catch a brick  you gotta be under an umbrella you'll get rained on i told hiphop and hiphop was all oh word actually even with that i was still about to take the deal with capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with h that you know cause i told him i was gonna do it and i'm a man of my word i was gonna roll with what i said i was gonna do then you know i'm not gonna name no names but people told me oh he's just a producerrapper and told h that told the heads of the capitol and right the day i'm talking about i planned out everything i was gonna do man i had picked out clothes i already started booking studio sessions i started arranging my album thinking of marketing schemes man i was ready to go and they had mel call me they said yo capitol pulled on the deal  mel yo capitol pulled out on the deal  and you know i told them that rocafella was interested and i don't know if they thought that was just something i was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever i went up i called g i said man you think we could still get that deal with rocafella  so won't you raise your glass won't you so won't you raise your glass won't you so won't you raise your glass won't you so won't you raise your glass won't you,21.0,"{'_type': 'song',

And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he\'s like ""Who that spittin\'?"" I\'m like ""It\'s me."" He\'s like ""Oh, well okay.""\nUhh, he started talkin\' to me on the phone, going back and forth\nJust askin\' me to send him beats, and I\'m thinking he\'s trying to get into managing producers, cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin\' with\n\nSo won\'t you raise your glass won\'t you\nSo won\'t you raise your glass won\'t you\nSo won\'t you raise your glass won\'t you\nSo won\'t you raise your glass won\'t you\n\nAnd um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, ""Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap""\n\nNo ID: ""Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap""\n\n[Saxophone Solo]\n\nI was all, I dunno if he was gassin\' me or not but he\'s like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer\n\n[Hiphop: ""I\'ll sign you as a producer and a rapper""]\n\nI\'m like oh shit. I was messin\' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that\'s how I got in the game. If it wasn\'t for that, I wouldn\'t be here. So you know, after they picked that ""Truth"" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn\'t poppin\' off like that. I was stayin\' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin\' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that\'s what we wore back then\nI made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he\'s like, ""Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin\', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren\'t soundin\' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off ""Xxplosive"" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it\'s kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on ""This Can\'t Be Life.""\n\nAnd that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I\'m sayin\' cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there\'s a time in every man\'s life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, ""Oh you a real soulful dude.""\n\n[JAY-Z: ""Oh you a real soulful dude, man""]\n\nAnd he, uh, played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said\n\n[JAY-Z: ""Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here""]\n\n""Tell me what you think of this."" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain\'t want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, ""What you think of it?""\n\n[JAY-Z: ""so what you think of this?""]\n\nAnd I was like, ""Man that shit tight,"" you know what I\'m sayin\', man what I\'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I\'m, I\'m just in Chicago, I\'m trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I\'m trying to get on, and like there wasn\'t nothin\' really like poppin\' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I\'m just straight holdin\' the phone, gettin\' the bad news that dude was tryin\' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain\'t have to deal with the landlord cause he\'s a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...\n\n[Donda West: ""Come on, let\'s just go""]\n\n...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn\'t even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...\n\n[Donda West: ""Kanye, baby, we\'re here""]\n\n...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, ""Heart of the City."" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans\' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did ""Nothing Like It"" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, ""Yo play that one beat for him."" And I played ""Heart of the City."" And really I made ""Heart of the City,"" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX\n\n[Hiphop: ""No I think Jay gon\' like this one right here""]\n\nAnd I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like \'OOOOOOOOOOH.\' Two days later I\'m in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn\'t know who I was and I was like, ""Yo what\'s up I\'m Kanye.""\n\n[Dame: ""Yo, you that kid, Kanye?""]\n\n""You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats""\n\n[Dame: ""Jay got classics, G.""]\n\nYou know I ain\'t talkin\' shit. I\'m like ""oh shit."" And all this time I\'m starstruck, man. I\'m still thinking \'bout, you know I\'m picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I\'m lookin\', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the \'Can\'t be Life\' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn\'t know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, ""yo Jay I could rap."" And I spit this rap that said, uh ""I\'m killin\' y\'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips."" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that\'s all the response. He said, ""Man that was tight.""\n\n[JAY-Z: ""That, that was cool. That was hot.""]\n\nThat was it. You know, I ain\'t get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, ""H to the Izzo,"" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn\'t have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R\'s, and they wanted beats from me, so they\'d call me up, I\'d play them some beats. ""Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z."" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I\'ll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I\'ll play my shit. I\'ll be like, ""yo but I rap too."" Hey, I guess they was lookin\' at me crazy cause you know, cause I ain\'t have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them \'Jesus Walks\' and they didn\'t sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R\'s that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it\'d be somebody at the company that\'ll say, ""Naw."" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...\n\n[Jessica: ""Man, you niggas is stupid if y\'all don\'t sign Kanye, for real.""]\n\nI\'m not gonna say nothin\' to mess my promotion up\n\n[""Y\'all niggas is stupid""]\n\nLet\'s just say I didn\'t get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn\'t even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad\n\n[Joe: ""We gonna change the game, buddy.""]\n\nDame was like, ""Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it\'s not wack.""\n\n[Dame: ""You gotta make sure it\'s not wack.""]\n\nThen one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it\'s a song that you\'ll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it\'s called \'Wow.\'\n\n""I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow\nI got 11 plaques on my walls right now\nYou got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.""\n\nLike the chorus went. Don\'t bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he\'s like ""oh shit""\n\n[Dame: ""Oh shit it\'s not even wack.""]\n\n""I ain\'t gonna front, it\'s kinda hot.""\n\n[Dame: ""it\'s actually kinda hot.""]\n\nLike they still weren\'t looking at me like a rapper. And I\'m sure Dame figured, \'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he\'s like ""yo man, B, B, you don\'t want a brick, you don\'t want a brick""\n\n[Dame: ""you don\'t wanna catch a brick""]\n\n""You gotta be under an umbrella, you\'ll get rained on."" I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, ""oh, word?"" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I\'m a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I\'m not gonna name no names, but people told me, ""oh he\'s just a producer-rapper,"" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I\'m talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, ""yo... Capitol pulled on the deal""\n\n[Mel: ""Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal.""]\n\nAnd, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don\'t know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, ""man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?""\n\nSo won\'t you raise your glass, won\'t you...\nSo won\'t you raise your glass, won\'t you...\nSo won\'t you raise your glass, won\'t you...\nSo won\'t you raise your glass, won\'t you...'}",The College Dropout
