Nah, can't make me\nEven if the money low, can't pay me\nEven if the money low, can't play me\n\n[Chorus]\nAyy, ya heard about the good news?\nY'all sleeping on me, huh? Had a good snooze?\nWake up, nigga, wake up\nWe 'bout to get this paper\n\n[Verse 2]\nPablo bought a Rolie and a rottweiler\nSeem like the more fame, I only got wilder\nHands up, we just doing what the cops taught us\nHands up, we just doing what the cops taught us\nI've been outta my mind a long time\nI've been outta my mind a long time\nI be saying how I feel at the wrong time\nMight not come when you want but I'm on time\n\n[Chorus]\nAyy, ya heard about the good news?\nY'all sleeping on me, huh?

You get a fur! You get a fur!\nYou get a jet! You get a jet! Big booty bitch for you! Woo!\n\n[Produced by Kanye West, Mike Dean, Plain Pat & Charlie Heat]"

Trust issues\nSwitched up the number, I can't be bothered\nI cannot blame you for havin' an angle\nI ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing\nHope you're doin' your thing, too\nI'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions\nFuck the church up by drinkin' at the communion\nSpillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined\nIn town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?\nWho your real friends? We all came from the bottom\nI'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem\nDamn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday\nWhy you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?\nWhen was the last time I remembered a birthday?\nWhen was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?\n\n[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]\nTell me you want your tickets when it's gametime\nEven to call your daughter on her FaceTime\nEven when we was young I used to make time\nNow we be way too busy just to make time\nEven for my...\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]\nReal friends\nI guess I get what I deserve, don't I?\nWord on the streets is they ain't heard from him\nI guess I get what I deserve, don't I?\nTalked down on my name, throwed dirt on him\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]\nI couldn't tell you how old your daughter was (Was)\nCouldn't tell you how old your son is (Is)\nI got my own Jr. on the way, dawg (Dawg)\nPlus I already got one kid (Kid)\nCouldn't tell you much about the fam though\nI just showed up for the yams though\nMaybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister\nMerry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business\nYou wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit? (Shit)\nLike I ain't got enough pressure to deal with (With)\nPlease don't pressure me with that bill shit (Shit)\nCause everybody got 'em that ain't children\nOh you've been nothin' but a friend to me\nNiggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me\nIt's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries\nTo be honest, dawg, I ain't feelin' your energy\nMoney turn your kin into an enemy\nNiggas ain't real as they pretend to be\n\n[Verse 3: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]\nLookin' for real friends\nHow many of us? How many of us are real friends\nTo real friends, 'til the reel end\n'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin (Yeah yeah)\nTo 3 A.M., callin'\nHow many real friends?\nJust to ask you a question\nJust to see how you was feelin'\nHow many?\nFor the last you was frontin'\nI hate when a nigga text you like, \"What's up, fam? Hope you good\"\nYou say, \"I'm good, I'm great,\" the next text they ask you for somethin'\nHow many?\nWhat's best for your family, immediate or extended\nAny argument, the media'll extend it\nI had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on\nPaid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him\nReal friends\nHuh?\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West,  Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]\nReal friends\nI guess I get what I deserve, don't I\nWord on the streets is they ain't heard from him\nI guess I get what I deserve, don't I\nTalked down on my name, throwed dirt on him"

    "lyrics": "[Intro: Kanye West]\nYeah, 9:08 L.A. time\nBack in the lab and shit\n\n[Verse 1: Kanye West]\nMy wife said, I can't say no to nobody\nAnd at this rate we gon' both die broke\nGot friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt\nAnd like my wife said, I still didn't say no\nPeople tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter\nMy friends' best advice was to stay low\nI guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills\nEspecially when you got family members on payroll\nThe media said it was outlandish spendin'\nThe media said he's way out of control\nI just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'\nI'm not out of control, I'm just not in their control\nI know I'm the most influential\nThat TIME cover was just confirmation\nThis generation's closest thing to Einstein\nSo don't worry about me, I'm fine\nI can see a thousand years from now in real life\nSkate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like\nTroll conventional thought, don't need to question\nI know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive\nThank God for Jay Electra, he down with the mission\nDid it with no permission, on our own conditions\nMost blacks with money have been beaten to submission\nYeezy with the big house, did it way different\nNever listen to Hollywood producers\nDon't stare at money too long, it's Medusa\nThe ultimate Gemini has survived\nI wasn't supposed to make it past 25\n\n[Chorus: Sampha]\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nWonderin' whether God's gonna say hi\nOh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nAnd you wonder where is God in your nightlife\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\n(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)\nWonderin' whether God's gonna say hi\nYeah, I feel like I'm home, yeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nI've been wakin' the spirits of millions more to come\nA million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums\nI believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro\nIf the phone ringin', go and get your kids, ho\nBrother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation\nHe sat back and smiled\nBlack on black lies is worse than black on black crime\nThe Jews share their truth on how to make a dime\nMost black men couldn't balance a checkbook\nBut buy a new car, talkin' 'bout, \"How my neck look?\"\nWell, it all looks great\nFour hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains\nThe light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard\nReal family stick together and see through the mirage\nThe smokescreens, perceptions of false reality\nWho the real owner if your boss gets a salary?\nI am one with the people\nI am one with the people (Real!)\nI've been woken from enlightened man's dream\nCheckin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self-esteem\nLet me not say too much or do too much\n'Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch\nI'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen\nSo the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'\nGod, I have humbled myself before the court\nDrop my ego and confidence was my last resort\nI know, I know He got a plan, I know I'm on Your beams\nOne set of footsteps, You was carryin' me\nWhen I turned on the news and they was buryin' me\nOne set of footsteps, You was carryin' me\nWhen I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me\nTold Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see\nI would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov\nI heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stove\nBut it's better that I stayed at home with my folks\n'Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go broke\nOnly thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go\nWe all go\nNot just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's Waldo\nShe got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo\nModern-day MJ, with a off-the-wall flow\n\n[Bridge: Sampha]\nNightlife, walk all over me\nWalk all over me\nI'm deliverin' everything I've ever sent that you'll bring\nFly, fly, fly overseas\nFly overseas\nOh, anywhere, everything but in between\nOh, yeah\n\n[Chorus: Sampha]\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nWonderin' whether God's gonna say hi\nOh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nAnd you wonder where is God in your nightlife\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nWonderin' whether God's gonna say hi\n(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)\nOh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nAnd you wonder where is God in your nightlife\n(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)\n\n[Verse 3: Sampha]\nPlease face me when I speak\nPlease say to me somethin' before you leave\nYou've been treatin' me like I'm invisible, now I'm visible to you\nOh, the invisible truth stay sober\nI can't quite understand the games you play\nUnderstand, understand, understand I'm standin' under oath\nAnd I promised I, I wouldn't fall anymore\nBut I'm cryin' at the bar\nI'm wishin' that you saw my scars, man\nI'm wishin' that you came down here and stood by me\nAnd looked at me like you knew me\nBut I feel so alone\nLike I don't know anyone except the night sky above\n\n[Chorus: Sampha]\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nWonderin' whether God's gonna say hi\nOh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nAnd you wonder where is God in your nightlife\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\n(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)\nWonderin' whether God's gonna say hi\nOh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nAnd you wonder where is God in your nightlife\n(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)"
