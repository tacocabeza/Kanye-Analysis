Nigga, we go way back\nTo when I had the braids and you had the wave cap\nDrop a pin for the fade and I'm on my way ASAP\nDon't get socked in the mouth, you know homie don't play that\nPay the fire marshal bill 'cause this shit done got way packed\nThey wanna see me go ape (Ape, ape)\nAll you gotta do is speak on Ye\nAll you gotta do is speak on Ye\nDon't get your tooth chipped like Frito-Lay"

Ain't no love lost, but the gloves off\nAnd we up in this bitch until they turn the club off\nHad to tell the dogs, \"Turn the snubs off!\"\nPlus they already mad that the Cubs lost\n(Believe it or not) These two wrongs'll right you\n(Believe it or not) I was too grown in high school\n(Believe it or not) The true soul of Ice Cube\nToo close to snipe you, truth told, I like you\nToo bold to type you, too rich to fight you\nCalm down, you light skin!\n\n[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Kid Cudi (Slick Rick)]\nMake no mistake, girl, still love you (Make no)\nMake no mistake, girl, still love you (No way)\n(Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)\nMake no mistake, girl, still love you\n(Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)\nMake no mistake, girl, still love you\n(Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)\nMake no mistake, girl, still love you (No way)\nMake no mistake, girl, still love you"
