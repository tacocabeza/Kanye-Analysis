(So high)\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh)\nCan we get much higher? (So high)\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh\nCan we get much higher? (So high)\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh)\nCan we get much higher? (So high)\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh\n\n[Verse 1: Kanye West]\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nI fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago\nMercy, mercy me, that Murci\u00e9lago\nThat's me the first year that I blow\nHow you say broke in Spanish? Mi no hablo\nMe drown sorrow in that Diablo\nMe found bravery in my bravado\nDJs need to listen to the models\nYou ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato? (You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?)\nStupid, but what the hell do I know?\nI'm just a Chi-Town nigga with a Nas flow\nAnd my chick in that new Phoebe Philo\nSo much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow\n\n[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]\nCan we get much higher?\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nLook like a fat booty Celine Dion\nSex is on fire, I'm the King of Leona Lewis\nBeyond the truest\nHey, teacher, teacher, tell me how do you respond to students?\nAnd refresh the page and restart the memory?\nRe-spark the soul and rebuild the energy?\nWe stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemy\nSorry for the night demons that still visit me\nThe plan was to drink until the pain over\nBut what's worse, the pain or the hangover?\nFresh air, rollin' down the window\nToo many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low\nDon't make me pull the toys out, huh\nDon't make me pull the toys\nAnd fire up the engines, huh\nAnd then they make noise\n\n[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]\nCan we get much higher? (So high)\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh\n\n[Bridge: Justin Vernon & Kanye West]\nAt the mall, there was a seance\nJust kids, no parents\nThen the sky filled with herons\nSaw the devil in a Chrysler LeBaron\nAnd the hell, it wouldn't spare us\nAnd the fires did declare us\nBut after that, took pills, kissed an heiress\nAnd woke up back in Paris\n\n[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]\nCan we get much higher? (So high)\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh\n\n[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]\nCan we get much higher? (So high)\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh)\nCan we get much higher? (So high)\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh\nCan we get much higher? (So high)\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh)\nCan we get much higher? (So high)\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh"

I'm saying\nI will never ever let you live this down, down, down\nNot for nothing, I've foreseen it, I dreamed it\nI can feel it slowly drifting away from me\nNo more chances, if you blow this, you bogus\nI will never ever let you live this down, down, down\n\n[Verse 1: Kanye West]\nPenitentiary chances, the devil dances\nAnd eventually answers to the call of autumn\nAll them fallin' for the love of ballin'\nGot caught with thirty rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin\nInter-century anthems based off inner-city tantrums\nBased off the way we was branded\nFace it, Jerome get more time than Brandon\nAnd at the airport, they check all through my bag\nAnd tell me that it's random\nBut we stay winning\nThis week has been a bad massage, I need a happy ending\nAnd a new beginning and a new fitted\nAnd some job opportunities that's lucrative\nThis the real world, homie, school finished\nThey done stole your dreams, you don't know who did it\nI treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS\nI won't be satisfied 'til all my niggas get it, get it?\n\n[Chorus: Kid Cudi]\nAin't no question if I want it, I need it\nI can feel it slowly drifting away from me\nI'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying\nI will never ever let you live this down, down, down\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nIs hip-hop just a euphemism for a new religion?\nThe soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing\nBut this is more than just my road to redemption\nMalcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention\nAs long as I'm in Polo smiling, they think they got me\nBut they'd try to crack me if they ever see a Black me\nI thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me\nIf a nigga ain't shootin' a jumpshot, runnin' a track meet\nBut this pimp is at the top of Mount Olympus\nReady for the world's games, this is my Olympics\nWe make 'em say ho 'cause the game is so pimpish\nChoke a South Park writer with a fishstick\nI insisted to get up off of this dick\nAnd these drugs, niggas can't resist it\nRemind me when they tried to have Ali enlisted\nIf I ever wasn't the greatest, nigga, I must have missed it\n\n[Chorus: Kid Cudi]\nAin't no question if I want it, I need it\nI can feel it slowly drifting away from me\nI'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying\nI will never ever let you live this down, down, down\n\n[Verse 3: Kanye West]\nI need more drinks and less lights\nAnd that American Apparel girl in just tights\nShe told the director she tryna get in a school\nHe said, \"Take them glasses off and get in the pool\"\nIt's been a while since I watched the tube\n'Cause like a Crip set, I got way too many blues for any more bad news\nI was looking at my resume, feeling real fresh today\nThey rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterday\nAnd what's a Black Beatle anyway, a fuckin' roach?\nI guess that's why they got me sitting in fuckin' coach\nMy guy said I need a different approach\n'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffin' coke\nIt's not funny anymore, try different jokes\nTell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O\nAnd kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it\nPlay strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit\nAct like I ain't had a belt in two classes\nI ain't got it, I'm coming after whoever who has it\nI'm coming after whoever, who has it?\nYou blowin' up, that's good, fantastic\nThat, y'all, it's like that, y'all\nI don't really give a fuck about it at all\n'Cause the same people that tried to blackball me\nForgot about two things, my Black balls\n\n[Chorus: Kid Cudi]\nAin't no question if I want it, I need it\nI can feel it slowly drifting away from me\nI'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying\nI will never ever let you live this down, down, down\n\n[Verse 4: Raekwon]\nAyy, yo\nI done copped Timbs, lived in lenses, kid\nArmani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots, and Benzes\nCounting up, smoking, one cuff\nLive as a red Jag', a Louis bag, grabbin' a blunt, fuck it\nSteam about a hundred and one L's\nKites off to jails, buyin' sweats, running up in Stetson\nNigga hat game was special\nIt matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals\nThe older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head\nMake sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead\nThat meant code red, bent off the black skunk\nThe black Dutch, back of the old shed\nIf you can't live, you dying, you give or buy in\nKeep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding\nKeep shining, to every young man, this is a plan\nLearn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye\n\n[Chorus: Kid Cudi]\nNot for nothing, I've forseen it, I dreamed it\nI can feel it slowly drifting away from me\nNo more chances, if you blow this, you bogus\nI will never ever let you live this down, down, down"

Motherfucker, we rolling\nWith some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands\nIn this white man world, we the ones chosen\nSo goodnight, cruel world, I'll see you in the morning\nHuh? I'll see you in the morning\nThis is way too much, I need a moment\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nNo one man should have all that power\nThe clock's ticking, I just count the hours\nStop tripping, I'm tripping off the power\n'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours\nAnd they say, and they say\nAnd they say, and they say\nAnd they say, and they say\n(21st-century schizoid man)\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nFuck SNL and the whole cast\nTell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass\nMore specifically, they can kiss my asshole\nI'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes\nYou short-minded niggas' thoughts is Napoleon\nMy furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in\nI embody every characteristic of the egotistic\nHe knows he's so fuckin' gifted\nI just needed time alone with my own thoughts\nGot treasures in my mind, but couldn't open up my own vault\nMy childlike creativity, purity, and honesty\nIs honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts\nReality is catching up with me\nTaking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody\nWith these responsibilities that they entrusted me\nAs I look down at my diamond-encrusted piece\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nThinking no one man should have all that power\nThe clock's ticking, I just count the hours\nStop tripping, I'm tripping off the powder\n'Til then, fuck that, the world\u2019s ours\nAnd they say, and they say\nAnd they say, and they say\nAnd they say, and they say\n(21st-century schizoid man)\n\n[Verse 3: Kanye West]\nColin Powells, Austin Powers\nLost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation\nThey say I was the abomination of Obama's nation\nWell, that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation\nAt the end of the day, goddamnit, I'm killing this shit\nI know damn well y'all feeling this shit\nI don't need your pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick\nI ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?\nHow Ye doing? I'm survivin'\nI was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'\nWhere the bad bitches, huh? Where you hidin'?\nI got the power make your life so excitin'\n\n[Outro: Kanye West & Dwele]\nNow this will be a beautiful death\nI'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go\nI'm letting everything go\nMmm, now this will be a beautiful death\nI'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go\nI'm letting everything go\nNow this will be a beautiful death\nJumping out the window, letting everything go\nLetting everything go\nYou got the power to let power go?\n(21st-century schizoid man)"

monster, no-good bloodsucker\nFat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble\nAs you run through my jungles, all you hear is rumbles\nKanye West samples, here's one for example\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nGossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it\nEverybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert\nProfit, profit, nigga, I got it\nEverybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nUh, the best living or dead hands down, huh\nLess talk, more head right now, huh\nAnd my eyes more red than the devil is\nAnd I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch\nMatter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this\nDo the rap and the track, triple-double, no assists\nAnd my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit\nArguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit\nI heard the beat, the same raps that gave the track pain\nBought the chain that always give me back pain\nFucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane\nChi nigga, but these hoes love my accent\nChick came up to me and said, \"This the number to dial\nIf you wanna make your number one your number two now\"\nMix that Goose and Malibu, I call it \"Malibooyah\"\nGoddamn, Yeezy always hit 'em with a new style\nKnow that motherfucker, well, what you gon' do now?\nWhatever I wanna do, gosh, it's cool now\nKnow I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now\nThink you motherfuckers really really need to cool out\n'Cause you'll never get on top of this\nSo, mami, best advice is just to get on top of this\nHave you ever had sex with a pharaoh?\nAh, put the pussy in a sarcophagus\nNow she claiming that I bruised her esophagus\nHead of the class and she just won a swallowship\nI'm livin' in the future so the present is my past\nMy presence is a present, kiss my ass\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West & Jay Z]\nGossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it\nEverybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert (Yeah)\nProfit, profit, nigga, I got it\nEverybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands\n\n[Verse 3: Jay Z]\nSasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness\nGoblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience\nQuestion, what do these things all have in common?\nEverybody knows I'm a motherfuckin' monster\nConquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense\nNonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is\nNone of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen\nI still hear fiends scream in my dreams\nMurder, murder in black convertibles, I\nKill a block, I murder the avenues, I\nRape and pillage your village, women and children\nEverybody want to know what my Achilles heel is\nLove, I don't get enough of it\nAll I get is these vampires and bloodsuckers\nAll I see is these niggas I made millionaires\nMillin' about, spillin' they feelings in the air\nAll I see is these fake fucks with no fangs\nTryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins\nI smell a massacre\nSeems to be the only way to back you bastards up\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nGossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it\nEverybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert\nProfit, profit, nigga, I got it\nEverybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands\n\n[Verse 4: Nicki Minaj]\nPull up in the monster, automobile gangsta\nWith a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka\nYeah, I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka\nYou could be the king, but watch the queen conquer\nOkay, first things first, I'll eat your brains\nThen I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs\n'Cause that's what a motherfuckin' monster do\nHair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do\nMonster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe\nYoung Money is the roster and a monster crew\nAnd I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face\nAnd if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't\nSo let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?\nBut my features and my shows ten times your pay?\n50K for a verse, no album out\nYeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it\nHotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent\nTony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wine it\nNicki on them titties when I sign it\nThat's how these niggas so one-track-minded\nBut really, really I don't give an F-U-C-K\n\"Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki, sh-she's fake\"\n\"She on a diet,\" but my pockets eatin' cheesecake\nAnd I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's child's play\nJust killed another career, it's a mild day\nBesides, Ye, they can't stand besides me\nI think me, you, and Am' should m\u00e9nage Friday\nPink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash\nI think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast\nNow look at what you just saw, this is what you live for\nAh, I'm a motherfuckin' monster\n\n[Outro: Justin Vernon & Charlie Wilson]\nI, I crossed the limelight\nAnd I'll, I'll let God decide\nAnd I, I wouldn't last these shows\nSo I, I am headed home (Headed home)\nI, I crossed the limelight\nAnd I'll, I'll let God decide, 'cide (No)\nAnd I, I wouldn't last these shows\nSo I, I am headed home (Head home)\nI, I crossed the limelight (No, the limelight)\nAnd I'll, I'll let God decide, 'cide\nAnd I, I wouldn't last these shows\nSo I, I am headed home\n\n[Produced by Kanye West, Mike Dean & Plain Pat]\n[Video directed by Jake Nava]"

Oh, she lose it\nShe putting on her makeup, she casually allure\nText message break-ups, the casualty of tour\nHow she gon' wake up and not love me no more?\nI thought I was the asshole, I guess it's rubbin' off\nHood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme\nHard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron\nI'm looking at her like, \"This what you really wanted, huh?\"\nWhy we argue anyway? Oh, I forgot, it's summertime\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nPut your hands to the constellations\nThe way you look should be a sin, you my sensation\nI know I'm preachin' to the congregation\nWe love Jesus, but she done learned a lot from Satan\nSatan, Satan, Satan\nI mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting\nWe ain't married, but tonight I need some consummation\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nWhen the sun go down, it's the magic hour, the magic hour\nAnd outta all the colors that'll fill up the skies\nYou got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes\nWhy you standing there with your face screwed up?\nDon't leave while you're hot, that's how Mase screwed up\nThrowin' shit around, the whole place screwed up\nMaybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us\nI hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat\nI ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat\nYou see, I always loved that sense of humor\nBut tonight, you should have seen how quiet the room was\nThe Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme\nThat's \"Dior Homme,\" not \"Dior, homie\"\nThe crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?\nYou love me for me, could you be more phony?\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nPut your hands to the constellations\nThe way you look should be a sin, you my sensation\nHaven't said a word, haven't said a word to me this evening\nCat got your tongue?\n\n[Instrumental Interlude: Mike Dean Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 3: Rick Ross]\nLookin' at my bitch, I bet she give your ass a bone\nLookin' at my wrist, it'll turn your ass to stone\nStretch limousine, sipping ros\u00e9 all alone\nDouble-headed monster with a mind of his own\nCherry-red chariot, excess is just my character\nAll-black tux, nigga's shoes lavender\nI never needed acceptance from all you outsiders\nHad cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired (Uh)\nBefore his jaw shattered, climbing up the Lord's ladder\nWe still speedin', running signs like they don't matter, uh\nHater talkin' never made me mad\nNever that, not when I'm in my favorite paper tag\nTherefore, G4s at the Clearport\nWhen it come to tools, fool, I'm a Pep Boy\nWhen it came to dope, I was quick to export\nNever tired of ballin', so it's on to the next sport\nNew Mercedes sedan, the Lex' sport\nSo many cars, DMV thought it was mail fraud\nDifferent traps I was gettin' mail from\nPolk County, Jacksonville, right in Melbourne\nWhole clique appetites had tapeworms\nSpinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burns\nI shed a tear before the night's over\nGod bless the man I put this ice over (Uh)\nGetting 2Pac money twice over\nStill a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice-roller\nI'm makin' love to the angel of death\nCatchin' feelings, never stumble, retracin' my steps (Uh)\nUh"
