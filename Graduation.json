Know\nFlashing lights (lights, lights)\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nI know it's been a while, sweetheart\nWe hardly talk, I was doin' my thang\nI know I was foul, baby\nAye, babe, lately, you've been all on my brain\nAnd if somebody woulda told me a month ago\nFrontin', though, yo, I wouldn't wanna know\nIf somebody woulda told me a year ago\nIt'll go get this difficult\nFeelin' like Katrina with no FEMA\nLike Martin with no Gina\nLike a flight with no Visa\nFirst class with the seat back, I still see ya\nIn my past, you on the other side of the glass\nOf my memory's museum\nI'm just sayin', hey, Mona Lisa\nCome home, you know you can't roam without Caesar\n\n[Hook: Dwele]\nAs I recall, I know you love to show off\nBut I never thought that you would take it this far\nWhat do I know?\nFlashing lights (lights, lights)\nWhat do I know? Know\nFlashing lights (lights, lights)\n\n[Outro: Dwele]\nAs you recall, you know I love to show off\nBut you never thought that I would take it this far\nWhat do you know?\nFlashing lights, lights, lights\nWhat do you know? Know\nFlashing lights (lights, lights)\nFlashing lights (lights, lights, lights, lights\u2026)"

He was black as the street was\nI'll never be laid back as this beat was\nI never could see why people'll reach a\nFake-ass facade that they couldn't keep up\nYou see how I creeped up?\nYou see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?\nI'll never rock a mink coat in the winter time like Killa Cam\nOr rock some mink boots in the summertime like will.i.am\nLet me know if you feel it, man\n'Cause everything I'm not made me everything I am\n\n[Chorus 2]\nDamn, here we go again\nEverybody saying what's not for him\nBut everything I'm not made me everything I am\nDamn, here we go again\nPeople talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan\nEverything I'm not made me everything I am\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd I'm back to tear it up\nHaters start your engines, I hear 'em gearing up\nPeople talk so much shit about me at barbershops\nThey forget to get their hair cut\nOkay, fair enough, the streets is flaring up\n'Cause they want gun talk, or I don't wear enough\nBaggy clothes, Reeboks, or A-di-dos\nCan I add that he do spaz out at his shows\nSo say goodbye to the NAACP Award\nGoodbye to the India Arie Award\nThey'd rather give me the N-nigga Please Award\nBut I'll just take the I Got a Lot of Cheese Award\n\n[Chorus 3]\nDamn, here we go again\nBum-tu-bum-bum-bum\nBut everything I'm not made me everything I am\nDamn, here we go again\nPeople talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan\nEverything I'm not made me everything I am\n\n[Verse 3]\nI know people wouldn't usually rap this\nBut I got the facts to back this\nJust last year, Chicago had over 600 caskets\nMan, killing's some wack shit\nOh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rappin'\nDo you know what it feel like when people is passin'?\nHe got changed over his chains a block off Ashland\nI need to talk to somebody, pastor\nThe church want tithe, so I can't afford to pay\nPink slip on my door, 'cause I can't afford to stay\nMy fifteen seconds up, but I got more to say\nThat's enough Mr. West, please, no more today\n\n[Chorus 2]\nDamn, here we go again\nEverybody saying what's not for him\nBut everything I'm not made me everything I am\nDamn, here we go again\nPeople talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan\nEverything I'm not made me everything I am"

Oh!\nNow I'm comin' home again\nMaybe we can start again\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nBut if you really cared for her\nThen you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams\nSometimes I still talk to her\nBut when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me\nShe said, \"You left your kids, and they just like you\nThey wanna rap and make soul beats just like you\nBut they just not you,\" and I just got through\nTalkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do: just not new\nNow everybody got the game figured out all wrong\nI guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone\nI guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home\nAnd guess when I heard that? When I was back home\nEvery interview, I'm representin' you, makin' you proud\nReach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloud\nJump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around\nIf you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout Chi-Town\n\n[Chorus: Chris Martin]\nI'm comin' home again\nDo you think about me now and then?\nDo you think about me now and then?\n'Cause I'm comin' home again\n-Min' home again\nBaby, do you remember when\nFireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!\nNow I'm comin' home again\n-Min' home again\nBaby, do you remember when\nFireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!\nNow I'm comin' home again\nMaybe we can start again\n\n[Outro: Chris Martin]\nLoy-oy-al, loy-oy-al\nComin' home again\nLoy-oy-al, loy-oy-al\nComin' home again\nMaybe we can start again"

Oh, that's you?\"\nBut by The Black Album, I was blacking out\nPartyin' S.O.B.'s and we had packed a crowd\nBig brother got his show up at Madison Square\nAnd I'm like \"Yeah, yeah, we gon' be there\" but\nNot only did I not get a chance to spit it\nCarline told me I could buy two tickets\nI guess big brother was thinkin' a little different\nAnd kept little brother at bay, at a distance\nBut everything that I felt was more bogus\nOnly made me more focused, only wrote more potent\nOnly thing I wanna know is why I get looked over\nI guess I'll understand when I get more older\nBig brother saw me at the bottom of the totem\nNow I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum\n\n[Hook]\nMy big brother was B.I.G.'s brother\nUsed to be Dame and Biggs' brother\nWho was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend\nNo I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin\nLet the story begin\nIf you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?\n\n[Verse 3]\nHave you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?\nNot only a client, the Presidito, hola, Hovito\nThe game gettin' foul so here's a free throw\nI was always on the other side of the peephole\nThen I dropped \"Jesus Walks\" now I'm on the steeple\nAnd we know, \"New Jack City\"\u2014got to keep my brother\nBut to be number one I'ma beat my brother\nOn that \"Diamonds\" remix I swore I spazzed\nThen my big brother came through and kicked my ass\nSibling rivalry, only I could see\nIt was the pride in me that was drivin' me\nAt the Grammys I said, \"I inspired me\"\nBut my big brother who I always tried to be\nWhen I kicked a flow it was like pick-and-roll\nCause even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-go\nI guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunk\nAnd my shit was more like a finger roll\nBut I had them singles though\nAnd them hoes at the show gonna mingle, yo, heh, y'all know\nI told Jay I did a song with Coldplay\nNext thing I know he got a song with Coldplay\nBack in my mind I'm like, \"Damn, no way\"\nTranslate, espa\u00f1ol: \"No way, Jos\u00e9\"\nThen I went and told Jay Brown\nShoulda known that was gonna come back around\nShoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first\nBut I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse\n\n[Bridge]\nMy big brother was B.I.G.'s brother\nSo here's a few words from ya kid brother\nIf you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'em\nPeople never get the flowers while they can still smell 'em\nA idol in my eyes, god of the game\nHeart of the City, Roc-a-Fella chain\nNever be the same, never be another\nNumber one, Young Hov, also my big brother\n\n[Hook]\nMy big brother was B.I.G.'s brother\nUsed to be Dame and Biggs' brother\nWho was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend\nNo I.D., my mentor, and that's where the story ends\n\n[Outro]\nToomp killed this shit"
