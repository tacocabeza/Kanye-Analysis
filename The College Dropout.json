Kids, sing!)\nWe wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-five\nJoke's on you, we still alive\nThrow your hands up in the sky and say\n\"We don't care what people say\"\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nThis second verse is for my dogs working nine to five that still hustle\n'Cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55\nAnd everybody selling makeup, Jacob's\nAnd bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up\nWe put shit on lay-away, then come back\nWe claim other people kids on our income tax\nWe take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid\nAnd we don't care what people say\nMama say she wanna move South\nScratching lottery tickets, eyes on a new house\n'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house\nCouldn't get a job\nSo since he couldn't get work, he figured he'd take work\nThe drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight\nSo niggas' money is homo, it's hard to get straight\nBut we gon' keep bakin' 'til the day we get cake\nAnd we don't care what people say, my niggas\u2014\n\n[Chorus: Choir & Kanye West]\nDrug dealin' just to get by (Yeah)\nStack your money 'til it get sky high\nKids, sing! Kids, sing!\nWe wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-five\nJoke's on you, we still alive (Alive, uh-huh)\nThrow your hands up in the sky and say\n\"We don't care what people say\" (Yeah, yeah, ugh)\n\n[Verse 3: Kanye West]\nYou know the kids gon' act a fool\nWhen you stop the programs for after school\nAnd they DCFS, some of 'em dyslexic\nThey favorite 50 Cent song \"12 Questions\"\nWe scream: \"rocks, blow, weed, park,\" see, now we smart\nWe ain't retards the way teachers thought\nHold up, hold fast, we make more cash\nNow, tell my mama I belong in that slow class\nIt's bad enough we on welfare\nThey tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair\nI'm tryna get the car with the chrome-y wheels here\nThey tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here\nLook what was handed us, fathers abandoned us\nWhen we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance\nSometimes, I feel no one in this world understands us\nBut we don't care what people say, my niggas\u2014\n\n[Chorus: Choir & Kanye West]\nDrug dealin' just to get by\nStack your money 'til it get sky high\nKids, sing! Kids, sing!\nWe wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-five\nJoke's on you, we still alive\nThrow your hands up in the sky and say\n\"We don't care what people say\"\n\n[Produced by Kanye West]"

Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?\nWe ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases\nA trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis\nMy mama used to say only Jesus can save us\nWell mama I know I act a fool\nBut I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move\nI hope\n\n[Chorus]\n(Jesus, walk)\nGod show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down\n(Jesus, walk with me)\nThe only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now\n(Jesus, walk)\nAnd I don't think there's nothin' I can do now to right my wrongs\n(Jesus, walk with me)\nI wanna talk to God but I'm afraid 'cause we ain't spoke in so long\n(Jesus, walk)\nGod show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down\n(Jesus, walk with me)\nThe only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now\n(Jesus, walk)\nAnd I don't think there's nothin' I can do now to right my wrongs\n(Jesus, walk with me)\nI wanna talk to God but I'm afraid 'cause we ain't spoke in so long\nSo long, so long\n(Jesus, walk with me)\n\n[Verse 2]\nTo the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers, even the scrippers\n(Jesus walks for them)\nTo the victims of welfare feel we livin' in Hell here, hell yeah\n(Jesus walks for them)\nNow, hear ye, hear ye, want to see Thee more clearly\nI know He hear me when my feet get weary\n'Cause we're the almost nearly extinct\nWe rappers is role models: we rap, we don't think\nI ain't here to argue about His facial features\nOr here to convert atheists into believers\nI'm just tryna say the way school need teachers\nThe way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus\nSo here go my single, dawg, radio needs this\nThey say you can rap about anything except for Jesus\nThat means guns, sex, lies, videotape\nBut if I talk about God my record won't get played, huh?\nWell if this take away from my spins\nWhich'll probably take away from my ends\nThen I hope this take away from my sins\nAnd bring the day that I'm dreamin' about\nNext time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out\n\n[Chorus]\n(Jesus, walk)\nGod show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down\n(Jesus, walk with me)\nThe only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now\n\n[Produced by Kanye West]"

Like four of them\nMore of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way\nClear the way, I'm here to stay\nY'all can save the chitter chat, this and that\nThis is Jay, dissing Jay will get you maced\nWhen I start spitting them lyrics niggas get very religious\nSix Hail Marys, 'Please Father forgive us'\nYoung the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas\nThe way y'all all follow Jigga\nHov's a living legend and I'll tell you why\nEverybody wanna be Hov and Hov's still alive"

Lyrics sticks to your rib)\nI mean (That's my favorite CD that I play at my crib)\nI mean (You don't really know him, why is you lyin'?)\nYo Kwe, she don't believe me, please pick up the line\nShe gon' think that I'm lyin', just spit a couple of lines\nThen maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time\nAnd get her high! Owww!\n\n[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]\nYeah, I can't believe this nigga use my name for pickin' up dimes\nBut never-mind, I need some tracks, you tryin' to pull tracks out\nAnd my rhymes is finna blow, you trying to blow backs out\nWell okay, you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charm\nAyo, ain't you meet that chick at that conference with your moms?\nAnd sister's the bomb, boy she got the bougie behavior\nAlways got something to say like a okay playa hater\nAnyways, I don't usually fuck with the Internet\nOr chicks with birth control stuck to they arm like Nicorette\nYou really fuckin' that much or tryna get off cigarettes? (Keep 'em high)\nIf she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet\nNow I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate\nI got the bubba kush and a sister could get a hit of it, yeah\n\n[Verse 4: Common]\nYo, yo\nGet 'em high like noon or the moon\nOr a room filled with smoke, a hype-filled with dope\nY'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune\nBut I still filled the notes with real nigga quotes\nReal rappers is hard to find, like a remote\nControl rap is out of\nUsed to, but still got love\nThat's why I abuse you who are not thugs\nRock clubs, it's like Tiger Woods in the hood\nShould have my own reality show, called Soul Survivor\nI stole on live-er niggas than you\nYou's a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you\nHow could I ever let your words affect me?\nThey say hip-hop is dead, I'm here to resurrect me\nMarsha's too sexy to even make songs like these\nThat's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys\nToo many featured emcees, and pro-ducers is popular\nTwelve thousand spins, nobody got to coppin' a\nAlbum, how come you the hot garbage of\nThe year? It's clear your image is looped up\nLabel got you souped up, tellin' you you sick\nWhen you a dick with a loose nut\nVideo hard to watch like Medusa\nEven your club record need a booster, chimped up\nWith a pimp cup, illiterate nigga, read the infra-\nRed across your head, I'm bred king like Simba\nBolder than Denver, I ain't a Madd Rapper\nJust a emcee with a temper\nYou dancin' for money like Honey, I did this my way\nSo when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye\nSpittin' through wires and fires, emcees retirin'\nGot your hands up, get them motherfuckers higher then\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West & Common]\nN-now, th-th-throw your motherfuckin' hands\n(Get 'em high, yeah)\nAll the girls pass the weed to your motherfuckin' man\n(Get 'em high, mm-mm, uh-uh)\nNow I ain't never tell you to put down your hands\n(Keep 'em high, keep 'em high, keep 'em high, uh-uh)\nAnd if you're losin' your high then smoke again\n(Keep 'em high)"

(Mali!)\nFirst nigga with a Benz and a backpack\nIce chain, Carti lens, and a knapsack\nAlways said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant\nBut now I'm rappin' 'bout money, hoes, and rims again\nAnd it's still about the Benjamins\nBig faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms\nStrippers named Cinnamon, more chips than Pentium\n\"What'cha gon' buy next?\" Whatever new trend it is\nI'm tryin' to spend my stacks, and I'm so broke\nI look back like \"Damn, was I on crack?\"\nI mean, twelve platinum chains, was I on that?\nWhat the hell was wrong with me dog?\nSing along with me y'all\n\n[Chorus: Ludacris]\nYeah, breathe in, breathe out\nIf ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out\nPush a big truck, pull ya keys out\nGirls go wild and pull ya D's out\nBreathe in, breathe out\nLet them hoes fight, pull her weave out\nIf a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out\nWhen I pull the piece out niggas like \"Peace out!\"\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nNow even though I went to college\nAnd dropped out of school quick\nI always had a Ph.D: a pretty huge dick\nLadies tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like this\nAnd givin' head is like a whale that's usin' a toothpick\nWell, I'm in the club for a limited time\nAct now and get some action for a $free.99\nLater on, I might charge for m\u00e9nage\nHeard her man was the boss of the floss\nBut she still want to toss me the drawers\nAnd it ain't gon' cost me because she my caddy\nCuz she grabbed my golf balls in the club\nAnd I'm still actin' calm den-a-muhh, she asked\n\"Can you drive me in the hundreds where my Altima was?\"\nWhile we drive she tellin' me 'bout problems with her man\nBaby, I fully understand, let me help you with a plan\nWhile he trickin' off, don't get no rich nigga\nGive me some head, that'll really piss him off\n\n[Chorus: Ludacris]\nYeah, breathe in, breathe out\nIf ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out\nPush a big truck, pull ya keys out\nGirls go wild and pull ya D's out\nBreathe in, breathe out\nLet them hoes fight, pull her weave out\nIf a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out\nWhen I pull the piece out niggas like \"Peace out!\"\n\n[Verse 3: Kanye West]\nI blow past low-class niggas with no cash\nIn the four dash six, bitch you can go ask\nSo when I go fast popo just laugh\nRight until I run out of gas or 'til I go crash\nWhatever comes first I'm prepared for the worst\nWhatever comes second I'll be there with my weapon\nPullin' up in the Lexuses, one on both hand\nSo I guess them GSes was ambidextrous\nCoulda sworn her breasteses was sendin' me messages\n\"K I need a free hand mammogram\nI got weed, drink, and a Handicam\nAll of which is legal in Amsterdam\"\nSo say my name like Candyman\nAnd I'ma come and fix you up like the handyman\nBut if you don't need a fix, girl you gotta leave\nYou can't take that all at one time ya gotta breathe\n\n[Chorus: Ludacris]\nYeah, breathe in, breathe out\nIf ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out\nPush a big truck, pull ya keys out\nGirls go wild and pull ya D's out\nBreathe in, breathe out\nLet them hoes fight, pull her weave out\nIf a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out\nWhen I pull the piece out niggas like \"Peace out!\"\n\n[Outro]\n\"And you say Chi city?\" scratched repeatedly"

Yes sir\nNow is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir\nThough the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest\nBut all they got left is this guy called West\nThat'll take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def\nCall him Kwa-li or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with JAY-Z\nI'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh\nIt come out sweeter than old Sadie\nNice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards\nGirl he had with him - ass coulda won the horse awards\nAnd I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye\nI'm almost Raymond\nSome say he arrogant, can y'all blame him?\nIt was straight embarrassing how y'all played him\nLast year shoppin' my demo, I was tryin' to shine\nEvery motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme\nNow I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem\nOr use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams\nI use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed\nBut without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh\nSo I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more\nYou niggas wear suits cause you can't dress no more\nYou can't say shit to Kanye West no more\nI rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga\nI'm Kon, the Louis Vuitton Don\nBought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom\nI ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards\nI prayed to the skies and I changed my stars\nI went to the malls and I balled too hard\n\"Oh my god, is that a black card?\"\nI turned around and replied, \"Why yes\nBut I prefer the term African American Express\"\nBrains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell\nYour boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to\nKillin y'all niggas on that lyrical shit\nMayonnaise-colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nAnd I am\n(Here's to the Roc)\nAnd they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them\n(Here's to Roc-A-Fella)\nRaise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and\n(Here's to the Roc)\nThis is the last call for alcohol, for my niggas\n(Mr. Rockefeller)\nSo get your ass up off the wall\n\n[Outro]\nSo this A&R over at Roc-A-Fella, named Hip Hop Picked the \"Truth\" beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like \"Who that spittin'?\" I'm like \"It's me.\" He's like \"Oh, well okay.\"\nUhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth\nJust askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with\n\nSo won't you raise your glass won't you\nSo won't you raise your glass won't you\nSo won't you raise your glass won't you\nSo won't you raise your glass won't you\n\nAnd um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, \"Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap\"\n\nNo ID: \"Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap\"\n\n[Saxophone Solo]\n\nI was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer\n\n[Hiphop: \"I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper\"]\n\nI'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that \"Truth\" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then\nI made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, \"Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off \"Xxplosive\" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on \"This Can't Be Life.\"\n\nAnd that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, \"Oh you a real soulful dude.\"\n\n[JAY-Z: \"Oh you a real soulful dude, man\"]\n\nAnd he, uh, played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said\n\n[JAY-Z: \"Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here\"]\n\n\"Tell me what you think of this.\" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, \"What you think of it?\"\n\n[JAY-Z: \"so what you think of this?\"]\n\nAnd I was like, \"Man that shit tight,\" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...\n\n[Donda West: \"Come on, let's just go\"]\n\n...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...\n\n[Donda West: \"Kanye, baby, we're here\"]\n\n...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, \"Heart of the City.\" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did \"Nothing Like It\" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, \"Yo play that one beat for him.\" And I played \"Heart of the City.\" And really I made \"Heart of the City,\" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX\n\n[Hiphop: \"No I think Jay gon' like this one right here\"]\n\nAnd I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, \"Yo what's up I'm Kanye.\"\n\n[Dame: \"Yo, you that kid, Kanye?\"]\n\n\"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats\"\n\n[Dame: \"Jay got classics, G.\"]\n\nYou know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like \"oh shit.\" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, \"yo Jay I could rap.\" And I spit this rap that said, uh \"I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips.\" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, \"Man that was tight.\"\n\n[JAY-Z: \"That, that was cool. That was hot.\"]\n\nThat was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, \"H to the Izzo,\" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. \"Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z.\" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, \"yo but I rap too.\" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy cause you know, cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, \"Naw.\" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...\n\n[Jessica: \"Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real.\"]\n\nI'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up\n\n[\"Y'all niggas is stupid\"]\n\nLet's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad\n\n[Joe: \"We gonna change the game, buddy.\"]\n\nDame was like, \"Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack.\"\n\n[Dame: \"You gotta make sure it's not wack.\"]\n\nThen one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'\n\n\"I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow\nI got 11 plaques on my walls right now\nYou got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.\"\n\nLike the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like \"oh shit\"\n\n[Dame: \"Oh shit it's not even wack.\"]\n\n\"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.\"\n\n[Dame: \"it's actually kinda hot.\"]\n\nLike they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like \"yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick\"\n\n[Dame: \"you don't wanna catch a brick\"]\n\n\"You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on.\" I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, \"oh, word?\" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, \"oh he's just a producer-rapper,\" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, \"yo... Capitol pulled on the deal\"\n\n[Mel: \"Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal.\"]\n\nAnd, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, \"man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?\"\n\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you...\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you...\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you...\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you..."
